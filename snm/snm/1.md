**1.Create a new user for a contractor, assign them to an "IT Support" group, and ensure they can only access the Incident application.
Solution:**

- Create the Contractor User
- Navigate to Users → User Administration > Users.
- Click New.
- Fill in details:
  - User ID: contractor1
  - First name / Last name: Contractor User
  - Email: contractor1@gmail.com
  - Active: Checked.
- Save.
- Assign the User to the "IT Support" Group
- On the user record, scroll to Groups (related list).
- Click Edit.
- Add to the IT Support group.
- Save.
- Restrict Access to Only the Incident Application
  Now we need to make sure this contractor can only work with Incident.

  **Option A: Role-Based Control (Mostly Preferred)**

- By default, Incident application requires itil role.
- Instead of giving full itil access (which gives too much), do the following:
  - Create a new custom role, ex: incident_contractor.
  - Assign this role only to permissions needed for Incident (using ACLs).
  - Assign the new role to your contractor user.
  - Do not give itil or other broad roles.

  **Option B: Application Menu Restriction**

- Go to System Definition > Application Menus.
- Open the Incident application menu.
- In the Roles field, add your custom role (incident_contractor).
  - This ensures only users with this role can see the Incident.
- Verify Access
- Impersonate the contractor user.
- Check:
  - They should only see the Incident application in the left nav.
  - They can open/create/edit incidents (based on the ACLs you configured).
  - They cannot access other apps (like Change, Problem, etc.).
